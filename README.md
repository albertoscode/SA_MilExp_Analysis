# Military Expenditure Analysis - South American Countries

This Jupyter Notebook contains code to analyze and visualize the military expenditure of South American countries using data from the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database. The notebook processes the raw data, extracts relevant information, and generates two types of bar charts: a simple bar chart for the military expenditure in 2021, and a grouped bar chart comparing the military expenditure in 2020 and 2021.

## Notebook Structure <a name="notebook-structure"></a>

The notebook is organized into sections as follows:

1. **Import Libraries**: Import the necessary Python libraries, such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and warnings.
2. **Data Processing Functions**: Define functions for reading and processing the raw data, extracting relevant data for South American countries, and saving the output to a CSV file.
3. **Data Visualization Functions**: Define functions for generating a bar chart for the military expenditure in 2021 and a grouped bar chart comparing the military expenditure in 2020 and 2021.
4. **Main Execution**: Call the functions to read and process the data, save the output to a CSV file, and generate the bar charts.
